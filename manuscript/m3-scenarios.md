# Scenarios

## 0: Pitched Battle

Deployment
: Attackers deploy within 12” of one edge, and defenders within 12” of the opposite edge.
Each side deploys one Group at a time, alternating between sides after each Group,
until both sides have deployed all the Groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play.

First Turn
: Attackers may choose to go first or allow the defender to go first.

Victory Conditions
: When fewer than 5 Groups remain across all Companies, roll 1d6 at the beginning of each subsequent turn.
If the result is higher than the number of remaining groups across all companies, this is the final turn.

  Add up the points value of enemy groups routed or destroyed before the end of the game; the player with the highest count gains 5VP.
  In a tie, all players tied for the highest count gain 3VP.

## 1: Ambush

Deployment
: Defenders deploy all of their Groups within 24” of the center, then attackers deploy all of their groups anywhere on the table, but no closer than 6” to any defending group.

First Turn
: Attackers must go first.

Victory Conditions
: Play ends immediately when either side has no Groups remaining in play.
Defenders gain 2VP for every friendly Group that escapes and 1VP for every enemy Group they rout or destroy.
Attackers gain 1VP for every enemy Group whose R is below its starting value at the end of the game (even if they escape off the table), and 2VP for every enemy Group they rout or destroy.

## 2: Retreat

Deployment
: Defenders deploy 12-18” from one edge, and attackers within 8” of the same edge.
Each side places one Group at a time, alternating between sides after each Group, until both sides have deployed all the Groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play.

First Turn
: Defenders may choose to go first or allow the attackers to go first.
After deciding, the defender must immediately make a resilience test for every group they deployed; for each test is failed, that Group starts play shaken.

Victory Conditions
:  During the game, defenders may retreat their Groups off of the table (must be from the edge opposite the edge from which they deployed).
Play ends immediately when either side has no Groups remaining in play.
Defenders gain 3VP for each of their Groups that escape.
Attackers gain 2VP for every enemy Group routed or destroyed—they gain 4VP instead if the enemy Captain’s Group is routed or destroyed.

## 3: Raid

Deployment
: Defenders deploy their Captain’s Group and up to half of their remaining groups within 24” of the center (leaving the remaining Groups out of play at the beginning of play), then attackers deploy all the Groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play within 12” of any edges.
Defenders then place 6 Asset Tokens (representing barrels of wine, prize cattle sacred stones, etc) within 24” of the center, representing valuable commodities the attackers may seek to capture.

First Turn
: Attackers may choose to go first or allow the defenders to go first.

Special Rules:
As their activation, any defending Group may test to activate on a 6+ to bring a not-yet-deployed group into play within 4”.
The defending Captain’s Group may make a test to activate on a 4+ to bring a not-yet-deployed group into play within 8”.
Defending Groups cannot pick up Asset Tokens.
As their activation, any attacking Group in contact with an Asset Token and not in melee may test to activate on a 5+ to pick up the Asset.
On a result of 12, the Group picks up the Asset and may immediately test to Move.
Groups carrying an Asset Token move at half their normal speed, and may carry the Asset off any table edge as part of a retreat.
Groups may only hold one Asset Token at a time.

Victory Conditions
: Play ends immediately when either side has no Groups remaining in play.
The defenders gain 2VP for each enemy group routed or destroyed, and 1VP for each Asset Token still on the table (either carried by a Group or not).
The attackers gain 3VP for each Asset Token taken off the table.

## 4: Sortie

Deployment
: Attackers deploy all the Groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play, as well as three Siege Tokens representing siege works at least 6” from any edge and no closer than 30” from the center.
Then the defenders deploy all the Groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play within 24” of the center.

First Turn
: Defenders must go first.

Special Rules
: As their activation, any defending group in contact with a Siege Token and not in melee may test to activate on a 6+ to destroy the siege work.

Victory Conditions
: Play ends immediately when either side has no Groups remaining in play,
or when the defenders move all of their remaining Groups within 24” of the center and declare an end to their sortie.
Defenders gain 1VP for every enemy Group routed or destroyed, 2VP for every enemy engine Group routed or destroyed, and 4VP for every Siege Token destroyed.
Attackers gain 2VP for every enemy Group routed or destroyed, 1VP for each of their engine Groups which was not routed or destroyed, and 3VP for every Siege Token not destroyed.

## 5: Extraction

Deployment
: Attackers deploy all the groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play at least 18” from the center.
Then defenders deploy one Group (the extractees) within 6” of the center, and all the remaining Groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play within 12” of any edge.

First Turn
: The defenders must go first.

Victory Conditions
: Play ends when the extractees escape off of the table, are routed, or are destroyed.
Defenders gain 6VP if the extractees escape, and 1VP for every enemy Group routed or destroyed.
Attackers gain 4VP if the extractees were routed or destroyed, and 2VP for every other enemy Group routed or destroyed.

## 6: Ritual

Deployment
: Defenders deploy all the Groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play within 24” of the center,
and designate one of their Groups as the bodyguards of the ritualists.
Then attackers deploy all the Groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play within 12” of any edges.

First Turn
: The attackers may choose to go first or let the defenders go first.

Special Rules
: The defender group bodyguarding the ritualists may not move.
If they would be forced to retreat by losing a melee or becoming shaken, they lose 1R instead.
At the beginning of each of the defender’s turns, roll 2d6—if the result is less than the current turn number, the ritual has been completed.

Victory Conditions
: Play ends when the ritual is completed or the bodyguard group is destroyed.
The defenders gain 6VP if the ritual is completed, and 1VP for each enemy group routed or destroyed.
The attackers gain 4VP if the bodyguard group is destroyed.
