# Introduction

This skirmish wargame is intended to:

* Be used with whatever models you have on hand, in any world you choose.
* Play out conflicts between factions on a scale of dozens (but not hundreds) of individuals.
* Lean into scenario-based and narrative play over pitched battles.
* Explicitly support kitbashing, hacking, reuse, and modularizing.

## Requirements for Play

To play this game you will need:

* These rules.
* Two or more players.
* A list of groups and their profiles.
* An army of miniatures (paper, plastic, pewter, or otherwise)—probably no more than 60 to a side.
* Six-sided dice. More is better—you’ll be rolling 2, 3, 6, or 12 of them at a time.
* A way to measure distance (a tape measure or ruler is probably best but a knotted string works, too).
* A table to play on. 6’x4’ is a good area for 24-point companies. Terrain, drawn or modeled, is also useful.
* Something to write with.
