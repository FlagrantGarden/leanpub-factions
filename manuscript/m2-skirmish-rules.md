# Skirmish Rules

## Setup

1. Choose points total for each side (typically 24).
2. Set up terrain.
3. Roll or choose a scenario.
4. Roll for Captain’s trait (or use existing trait if an established character).
5. Players arrange themselves into two sides, as evenly as possible. Roll 1d6 each to determine which side will be attackers and which will be defenders: higher result is the attacker. Reroll ties. Unless otherwise specified in the scenario, the attackers take the first turn.
6. Deploy companies according to the scenario guidelines (each side with the same number of Company points).
7. Choose ambitions.
8. The active player takes their turn.

## General

* Round down unless otherwise noted.
* Distance and range are measured between the closest models in each Group.
* Facing doesn’t matter.
* Groups on the same side (attackers or defenders) are considered friendly. Groups on opposing sides are considered enemies.

## Terrain

Difficult
: Each inch of movement through difficult terrain costs 2” of a model’s MO instead of 1”.

Obstacle
: If a model comes into base contact with an obstacle, it stops its Move for this activation (maintaining cohesion). If a model begins its Move in contact with an obstacle, it ignores the obstacle for the purposes of movement this activation. If a model is within 3” of an obstacle, they count as being in cover.

Cover
: Reroll all to-hit dice that hit against Groups on the opposite side of cover.

Obscuring
: Groups  cannot see things past obscuring terrain, or more than 3” into it.

Impassable
: Models cannot move through impassable terrain.

## Captains

* Cannot leave their Group, and are the last model in their Group to be removed.
* Friendly Groups within 12” of the Captain’s Group have +1 to all Resilience tests, unless the Captain’s Group is Shaken.

## Turns

The active side tests to activate Groups until an activation is failed or they choose to end their turn.

## Activation Phase

At the beginning  of activation, in order:

1. Rally Shaken Groups. All Shaken friendly Groups make a Resilience test to remove Shaken status. If unsuccessful, the Group loses 1R and retreats; this does not end the turn. All Shaken friendly Groups must test to rally, but may do so in any order.
2. Make checks for Reckless Groups. If any friendly Group with the Reckless trait is within their movement range of an enemy, they must test to Attack an enemy Group of your choice in range. If successful, Attack as normal; otherwise, they remain stationary, but this does not end the turn.

For each remaining Group:

1. Choose a Group to activate. Each Group may activate only once each turn.
2. Assign an order to the chosen Group (Move, Shoot, or Attack).
3. Roll 2d6 for the activation test, attempting to meet or exceed the Group’s relevant activation threshold for their given order.
   On a success, the Group performs the chosen order; on a failure, they do not.
4. If the chosen Group failed their activation test, end your turn and the next player’s turn begins.
   Otherwise, choose another friendly Group to activate, or choose to end your turn.

### Move

Move each model individually.
Models may not move through other models unless otherwise stated.

Cohesion
: At the end of a Move, all models in a Group must be within 3” of at least one other model in that Group, and must be at least 3” from enemy Groups (unless in melee with them).

### Shoot

If the activating Group has a MI profile, they may choose a target Group within range that they can see.

If the activating Group is above half their starting R, roll 12d6 to hit.
Otherwise, roll 6d6.
Each die that shows a result equal to or higher than the activating Group’s MI value is a hit.
For each number of hits equal to the target’s T, reduce their R by 1.
If the target lost any R, it must make a Resilience test.

### Attack

If the activating Group has a ME profile, they may choose a target within their movement distance that they can see.

If already in melee, the Group may test to activate and either Attack or Retreat.

To Attack:

1. Move as many models as possible into base contact with the target Group.
   * If target Group has the Defiant or Elusive traits, they may test to activate that trait. If successful, resolve their interrupting action; otherwise, they stand still and the attack continues as normal.
2. Both Groups Attack each other.
   Each rolls 12d6 to hit if above half their starting R; otherwise, they roll 6d6.
   Each die that shows a result equal to or higher than the activating Group’s MI value is a hit (Shaken Groups only hit on a 6).
   For each number of hits equal to the enemy’s T, reduce the enemy’s R by 1.

## Retreat

The retreating Group moves half their MO distance directly away from the cause of retreat.
They may not pass within 3” of any enemy Groups.

If blocked by terrain or enemy Groups, roll 1d6 vs their current R; if lower, they lose R equal to the roll and stop moving.

If any member of the Group retreats off of the table, the entire Group counts as having routed—remove them from play.

## Resilience Tests

Test for a specific Group immediately when they:

* Lose R.
* Are attempting to rally.
* Become the last Group of their Company.

Test once for every remaining Group immediately when:

* The Captain is killed or flees the table.
* The Company has lost Groups worth half or more of the total points fielded by their Company.

To test Resilience:

1. Roll 2d6.
2. Modify the roll:
   * Subtract 1 from the result for each R lost (if testing due to lost R)
   * Subtract 1 from the result if the Group’s Company has less than half of their total points still in play
   * Add 1 to the result if the Captain’s Group is within 12”.
3. If the final result is equal or higher than the Group’s R rating, they succeed.

If successful and rallying, the Group is no longer Shaken.

If failed, but the final result is greater than 0, the Group retreats and becomes Shaken (if already Shaken, they lose 1 R instead).
If the final result is 0 or less, remove the Group from play.

## Shaken Groups

* Must test to rally at the beginning of next activation phase and may not activate for any other reason
* Only hit on a 6 in melee (not when Shooting)
* Lose 1R and retreat when failing a Resilience Test

If the Captain’s Group is Shaken, none of their special rules affect play

## End of Game

When the chosen scenario's victory conditions are met, total VP according to the scenario guidelines to determine the winning side.
