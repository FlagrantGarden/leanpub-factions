# Companies & Captains

## Constructing Companies

Each side’s army, known as their Company, is made up of two or more Groups with different abilities and weaknesses. Each Group is made up of some number of models.

Each side must:

* Field 2-8 Groups costing 1-12 points each, noting their profile to your opponent—the number of models in a Group doesn’t matter.
* Spend no more than 24 points total for a standard game.

## Scaling Companies

Players may agree to scale their Company points up or down from 24 (increments of 6 work well).
Both sides should use the same number of points to construct their Companies.
Consider using smaller tables for smaller Company sizes, and larger tables for larger Companies.
The distances in Flagrant Factions assume 28mm models, so you may want to modify the distance increments if using larger or smaller models.

## Resilience

A Group’s ability to fight is defined by their current Resilience (R).
R always starts at 6 or 12.
When reduced to half or less of their initial R, a Group is Shaken—they roll half as many dice to hit, and are more vulnerable to psychological statuses.

You must always state the current R of a Group if asked.

Losing R represents a combination of  shock, fatigue, injury, and death in a Group, and reduces the Group’s ability to engage in the skirmish.
When reduced to 0R, a Group is unable to continue participating: they’re broken or captured or slaughtered.

A useful way to express the loss of R on the table is to remove models from a Group. For example, assuming a 12R Group:

* If the Group consists of 1 model, leave it on the table until R is reduced to 0 (or the Group flees).
* If the Group consists of 2 models, remove one model when R drops to 6 or less.
* If the Group consists of 3 models, remove one model every time the Group loses 4R (once at 8R, and again at 4R).
* If the Group consists of 6 models, remove one model every time the Group loses 2R.
* If the Group consists of 12 models, remove one model every time the Group loses 1R.
* If the Group consists of 24 models, remove two models every time the Group loses 1R.

T> It’s best to ensure your model count divides evenly into the R of the Group, but you can have any number you please.
T> Just remember to update each Group’s R on your roster as it lowers.

## Captains

Designate one model in each Company as the Captain.
This model is part of a Group and may not join any other Groups, does not increase the R of the Group they are in, and costs no additional points.

Captains start with one trait (roll or pick from the table below):

|  3d6  |       Trait       | Effect                                                                                                                                                        |
| :---: | :---------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   3   | **Reprehensible** | After deployment, whether or not the Captain is on the table, roll 1d6 for every Group except the Captain’s. On a 1, remove that Group from play—they desert. |
|   4   |     **Vapid**     | Captain does not grant a bonus on Resilience tests to nearby Groups.                                                                                          |

|   6   |    **Feeble**     | Captain’s Group rolls one fewer die when Attacking or Shooting.                                                                                               |
|   7   |    **Vicious**    | When any Group within 12” fails to rally, they may lose 1R to pass instead.                                                                                   |
|   8   |    **Shrewd**     | You may add or subtract 1 from your roll when determining attacker and defender at the start of the game.                                                     |
|   9   |   **Resolute**    | Captain and Captain’s Group are unaffected by fear effects.                                                                                                   |
|  10   |    **Capable**    | Once each turn, Captain’s Group may reroll one die when rolling to hit.                                                                                       |
|  11   |  **Compelling**   | Once each turn, one Group within 12” of the Captain may reroll a failed activation test.                                                                      |
|  12   |   **Prodding**    | Once each turn, one Group within 12” of the Captain may automatically pass a Move activation test.                                                            |
|  13   |  **Aggressive**   | Once each turn, one Group within 12” of the Captain may automatically pass an Attack activation test.                                                         |
|  14   |    **Shooter**    | Once each turn, one Group within 12” of the Captain may automatically pass a Shooting activation test.                                                        |
|  15   |   **Dangerous**   | Once each turn, Captain’s Group may reroll two dice when rolling to hit.                                                                                      |
|  16   |    **Calming**    | Once each turn, one Group within 12” of the Captain may ignore a compulsory activation as the result of the Reckless trait.                                   |
|  17   |    **Abjured**    | Captain’s Group cannot be targeted by enemies’ spells.                                                                                                        |
|  18   |  **Incredible**   | Once each turn, Captain’s Group may reroll three dice when rolling to hit.                                                                                    |

## Ambitions

During setup, players may secretly choose any number of different ambitions to fulfill during a skirmish.
At the end of the game, each fulfilled ambition earns the player 1-3 VP, and each unfulfilled ambition subtracts 1 from their VP.
Optionally, players may reveal any of their chosen ambitions, increasing the worth of each by 1.
